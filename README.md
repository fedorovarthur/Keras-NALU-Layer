# Keras Add-on

Keras implementation of variety of the newest layers, losses, activations, etc. from the recent research papers.

By now there is the implementation of:
1. Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit and Neural Accumulator, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00508.pdf
2. Gaussian Error Linear Units, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08415.pdf
3. Relational Loss, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03145.pdf
